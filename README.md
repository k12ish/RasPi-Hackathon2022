# FridgeGuard

Food theft is ubiquitous in shared Kitchens. 
FridgeGuard seeks to end this crisis by catching thieves on camera using a Raspberry Pi.

### Usage


### Technical Challenges

Unfortunately, battery tech has not advanced enough to leave cameras recording for multiple days on a power pack.
To work around this, we use an accelerometer which detects when the fridge door is opened.
The circuitry alerts the Rasberry Pi, which promptly begins recording.

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4, 
- Wide angle camera 
- Breadboard with an accelerometer
