# Raspi-Hackathon2022:FridgeGuard!!!

Features:
Will help guard your food by starting a recording of anyone moving your fridge food

Inspiration
our food being stolen


How we built it
We used a raspberry pi 4 with a camera and a circuit with an accelerometer to detect when the container is being moved. When this happens, the raspberry pi 4 will detect this and respond by recording a video, then saving it. When you realise your food has been stolen you can check the footage of the thief.

What we learned

Whats next?
Not need the fridge to be yanked with incredible force; increase sensitivity (suitably)
